### What do I think about market?
well it is getting desperate again. Whole market structure is about to experience a one in a lifetime market shift and nobody seems to understand what is coming. In short order I will list the anomalies and human fallacies:

- About $15 trillion of negative interest bearing debt out there.
- Rising unrest in the world: middle east as usual suspect but also asia, Hong Kong etc.
- Rising Gold again (I will post a note for gold later so stick around!)
- Stalling US growth. China and Europe as well.
- Central Banks and governments look so dump against all this developments. They, I guess, should be sensing this time is different but again they know their tool box is full of old weapons not effective against what is coming.

Well if you are asking what to do in defence, again my advise list:

1. Run to the bunkers! 
2. Go BIG SHORT.
