Here we are again I am gonna post a couple of notes about real estate valuation and appraisal topics. Since I am decided to go ahead and get my Capital Markets Board lisence.
- First I will set my plan and time line.
- To do that I need to find out which courses and test I need to pass.
- Retrive the last 3 years tests and go through them
- Get course notes and study.
- Apply for the test and get the company sponsorship to pay for bills.
- Get the lisence 
- Put it in a nice frame and hang on my office wall.
